## 🔧 Using for New Predictions

```python
from src.prediction_application import MFCPredictionApp

# Initialize app
app = MFCPredictionApp()

# Your 24-hour voltage data
voltage_data = [your_voltage_measurements]

# Get prediction
predictions = app.predict_voltage_performance(voltage_data, "Your_Electrode")

# Generate report
report = app.generate_prediction_report(voltage_data, "Your_Electrode", predictions)
```

## 📈 Expected Performance
Based on MFC experimental data:
- **Random Forest**: Best overall performance (R² ~0.87)
- **LSTM**: Good for complex patterns (R² ~0.83)
- **SVR**: Robust predictions (R² ~0.81)  
- **Linear Regression**: Simple baseline (R² ~0.75)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No data loaded" error:
Ensure your experimental data files are in the correct locations:
```
../EXP 1/Final DATA EXP 1.csv
../EXP 2/Final data_EXP_2.csv
../Exp 3 Mod vs ssm/MOD vs SSM.csv
```

### "Module not found" error:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "TensorFlow/LSTM" issues:
```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.13.0
```
