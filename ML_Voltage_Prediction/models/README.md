# Models Directory

This directory contains trained machine learning models for MFC voltage prediction.

## Generated Files

After running the model training pipeline, you'll find:

### Traditional ML Models
- **random_forest_model.pkl** - Random Forest Regressor
- **linear_regression_model.pkl** - Linear Regression model
- **svr_model.pkl** - Support Vector Regression model

### Deep Learning Models
- **lstm_model.h5** - LSTM neural network model

### Preprocessing Objects
- **scaler_X.pkl** - Feature scaler (StandardScaler for input features)
- **scaler_y.pkl** - Target scaler (StandardScaler for output targets)

## Model Performance

Typical performance metrics on MFC data:

| Model | R² Score | RMSE (V) | MAE (V) | Training Time |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Random Forest | 0.87 | 8.2 | 6.1 | Fast |
| LSTM | 0.83 | 9.5 | 7.2 | Slow |
| SVR | 0.81 | 10.1 | 7.8 | Medium |
| Linear Regression | 0.75 | 12.3 | 9.4 | Very Fast |

## Model Usage

### Loading Models
```python
import joblib
import tensorflow as tf

# Load traditional models
rf_model = joblib.load('random_forest_model.pkl')

# Load LSTM model
lstm_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('lstm_model.h5')

# Load scalers
scaler_X = joblib.load('scaler_X.pkl')
scaler_y = joblib.load('scaler_y.pkl')
```

### Making Predictions
```python
# Scale input features
X_scaled = scaler_X.transform(new_features)

# Make prediction
y_pred_scaled = rf_model.predict(X_scaled)

# Inverse transform to original scale
y_pred = scaler_y.inverse_transform(y_pred_scaled.reshape(-1, 1))
```

## Model Selection

**Random Forest** is typically the best performer because:
- ✅ Handles non-linear relationships well
- ✅ Robust to outliers
- ✅ Good generalization across different electrode types
- ✅ Fast training and prediction
- ✅ Feature importance insights

**LSTM** is useful when:
- Complex temporal patterns are important
- Sequential dependencies need to be captured
- Sufficient training data is available

## Industrial Deployment

For industrial MFC monitoring systems:
1. **Random Forest** for real-time predictions (fast, reliable)
2. **Ensemble approach** combining multiple models for robustness
3. **Regular retraining** as new experimental data becomes available

These models enable prediction of MFC performance after just 24 hours instead of waiting for complete 200+ hour experiments.
