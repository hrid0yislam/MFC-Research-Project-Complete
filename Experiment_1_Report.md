## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive electrochemical evaluation of four distinct anode materials in microbial fuel cell (MFC) configurations treating artificial dairy wastewater over a 232-hour operational period. A novel carbon black-modified stainless steel mesh (CB-SSM) electrode was developed and compared against conventional materials including pristine stainless steel mesh (SSM), Toray carbon paper, and standard carbon paper under realistic industrial wastewater conditions. Using artificial dairy wastewater with high organic loading (COD: 5302 mg/L), the CB-SSM electrode demonstrated superior electrochemical performance with sustained voltage output of 0.31V and exceptional long-term stability, significantly outperforming conventional materials. The study demonstrates the viability of MFC technology for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery from dairy industry effluents.
