\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Aquaculture Wastewater Treatment Challenges}

The aquaculture industry generates substantial volumes of high-strength wastewater characterized by elevated organic content, nutrient loads, and complex biochemical composition. Fish farm effluents typically contain high levels of organic matter (COD 5,000-15,000 mg/L), dissolved nutrients, and suspended solids that require effective treatment before discharge. Traditional treatment approaches are energy-intensive and may not achieve optimal resource recovery. Bioelectrochemical systems offer innovative solutions by simultaneously treating wastewater and generating energy.

\subsection{Carbon Black Enhancement for Aquaculture Applications}

Carbon black modification of electrode surfaces provides enhanced bioelectrochemical performance specifically beneficial for high-strength aquaculture wastewater treatment. The increased surface area, improved electrical conductivity, and enhanced biofilm attachment sites offered by carbon black incorporation directly address the challenges of treating complex organic loads typical in fish farm effluents.
