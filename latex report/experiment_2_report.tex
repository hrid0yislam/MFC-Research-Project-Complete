    \begin{abstract}
    This comprehensive study presents an in-depth electrochemical performance evaluation of four distinct electrode configurations in microbial fuel cell systems treating high-strength artificial dairy wastewater over an extended 302-hour operational period. The investigation focused on a carbon black-modified stainless steel mesh (10\% CB-SSM) electrode compared against commercial Toray carbon paper, conventional carbon paper, and pristine stainless steel mesh under industrially relevant conditions. Using artificial dairy wastewater with exceptionally high organic loading (COD: 5,302 mg/L), the modified CB-SSM electrode demonstrated superior treatment efficiency achieving 73\% COD removal while maintaining electrochemical stability. The study reveals critical insights into long-term electrode behavior, biofilm dynamics, and treatment-energy generation trade-offs essential for industrial-scale implementation.
