    \begin{abstract}
    This study presents a comprehensive electrochemical evaluation of four distinct anode materials in microbial fuel cell (MFC) configurations treating artificial dairy wastewater over a 232-hour operational period. A novel carbon black-modified stainless steel mesh (CB-SSM) electrode was developed and compared against conventional materials under realistic industrial wastewater conditions. Using artificial dairy wastewater with high organic loading (COD: \SI{5302}{\milli\gram\per\liter}), the CB-SSM electrode demonstrated superior electrochemical performance with sustained voltage output of \SI{0.31}{\volt} and exceptional long-term stability. The study demonstrates the viability of MFC technology for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery from dairy industry effluents.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Industrial Wastewater Treatment Challenge}

The dairy industry generates significant volumes of high-strength wastewater characterized by elevated organic content, nutrients, and complex biochemical oxygen demand. Traditional treatment methods are energy-intensive and costly, creating opportunities for bioelectrochemical approaches that combine treatment with energy recovery. Microbial fuel cells offer a promising solution by converting organic pollutants directly into electrical energy while achieving wastewater remediation.

\subsection{Artificial Dairy Wastewater as Model System}

Artificial dairy wastewater provides a controlled, reproducible substrate for MFC research while maintaining realistic industrial characteristics. The complex composition includes proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nutrients typical of actual dairy processing effluents, enabling systematic evaluation of electrode performance under industrially relevant conditions.

\subsection{Research Objectives}

This investigation aims to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate electrode performance under realistic dairy wastewater conditions
    \item Assess the viability of carbon black modification for industrial applications
    \item Determine treatment efficiency alongside energy generation
    \item Establish design principles for industrial-scale MFC implementation
\end{enumerate}

\section{Materials and Methods}

Table~\ref{tab:wastewater_recipe} presents the exact formulation used to prepare the artificial wastewater, while Table~\ref{tab:wastewater_params} presents both the initial wastewater composition and the final effluent quality after treatment by each electrode material.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Artificial Dairy Wastewater Formulation Recipe}
\label{tab:wastewater_recipe}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Amount per Liter} & \textbf{Purpose} \\
\midrule

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This formulation provides a complex organic substrate mixture that closely mimics the biochemical composition of actual dairy processing wastewater, including proteins, carbohydrates, and essential nutrients for microbial activity.

\end{table}

The initial wastewater parameters reflect medium-to-high strength dairy wastewater typical of cheese processing, milk powder production, or combined dairy operations. The treatment results demonstrate significant pollutant removal capabilities of all electrode materials, with notable differences in performance.

\subsection{Wastewater Preparation Methodology}

The artificial dairy wastewater was prepared by dissolving all components listed in Table~\ref{tab:wastewater_recipe} in distilled water. This formulation was specifically designed to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Replicate dairy complexity}: Combination of simple sugars (glucose) and organic acids (acetate) mimics lactose breakdown products
    \item \textbf{Provide protein content}: Peptone/casein hydrolysate represents milk proteins and cheese processing residues
    \item \textbf{Supply essential nutrients}: N-P-K nutrients support microbial growth and biofilm formation
    \item \textbf{Maintain ionic balance}: Chloride salts provide conductivity similar to real dairy effluent
    \item \textbf{Enable trace metal availability}: Iron supports electron transfer processes in bioelectrochemical systems
\end{itemize}

The resulting synthetic wastewater exhibits a high Chemical Oxygen Demand (5,302 mg/L) typical of concentrated dairy processing streams, making it an excellent surrogate for industrial dairy effluent treatment studies.

    \item \textbf{Standard Carbon Paper}: Conventional carbon paper electrode
\end{itemize}
