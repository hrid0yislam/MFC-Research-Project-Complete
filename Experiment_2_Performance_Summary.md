## Industrial Application Recommendations

### üîã **For Maximum Treatment Efficiency:**
**Use Modified Electrode (10% Carbon Black + SSM)**
- Achieves highest organic removal (73%)
- Best overall water quality improvement
- Most suitable for high-strength dairy wastewater

### ‚ö° **For Maximum Energy Generation:**
**Consider Toray Carbon Paper**
- Highest electrical output potential
- Requires careful monitoring and maintenance
- May need system cycling or replacement protocols

### üîÑ **For Balanced Performance:**
**Modified Electrode remains the best choice**
- Combines good treatment efficiency with reasonable electrical performance
- Shows recovery capability and long-term stability
- Most reliable for continuous industrial operation

## Critical Insights

1. **Treatment vs. Energy Trade-off**: Higher electrical output doesn't always mean better treatment efficiency

2. **Long-term Stability Matters**: Peak performance is less important than sustained operation for industrial applications

3. **Carbon Black Modification Works**: The 10% carbon black addition significantly improves both treatment efficiency and system stability

4. **System Recovery**: The modified electrode's ability to recover from initial negative voltage shows resilience important for industrial conditions

## Conclusion

**The Modified Electrode (10% Carbon Black + SSM) is the clear winner** for industrial dairy wastewater treatment applications, providing the best combination of:
- Treatment efficiency (73% COD removal)
- System stability and recovery capability  
- Long-term reliability
- Overall water quality improvement

While Toray carbon paper achieved higher peak electrical output, its poor long-term stability makes it unsuitable for continuous industrial operation without frequent maintenance interventions.
